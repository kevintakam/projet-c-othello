To test , uplaod the files then change the name by deleting the "final_"part.
Otherwise you'll have some include errors.

The SDL code version is available in the drive link below:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AoGQtBUHrrPXEErDCVDRmef7Mw5X24TV?usp=sharing

Either check the drive OR you can just check the release to see the final outcome of the SDL version.

Everything else works fine. The music plays infinitly.
